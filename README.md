Planisuss

1. The Planisuss world
The Planisuss world is constituted of a single continent which is populated by three species: Veg- etob, Erbast, and Carviz. In the simulation, several individuals of the species interact evolving their population under the rules explained in the next sections.

**2. The ecosystem**
Three species populates Planisuss:
Vegetob (pl. Vegetob) is a vegetable species. Spontaneously grows on the ground with a regular cycle. Vegetob is the nutrient of Erbast.
Erbast (pl. Erbast) is a herbivore species. Erbast eat the Vegetob. Can move on the continent to find better living conditions. Individuals can group forming a herd.
Carviz (pl. Carviz) is a carnivore species. Carviz predate Erbast. Can move on the continent to find better living conditions. Individuals can group forming a pride.
Erbast and Carviz are animal species.


**3. A day on Planisuss**
The time on Planisussis structured in units called day. A day is articulated in the following phases:

**Growing** The Vegetob grows everywhere of a fixed quantity (1 unit).

**Movement** The individuals of animal species (Erbast and Carviz) decide if move in another area. Movement is articulated as individual and social group (herd or pride) movement. 

**Grazing** Erbast which did not move, can graze the Vegetob in the area.

**Struggle** Carviz insisting on the same area can fight or hunt.

**Spawning** Individuals of animal species can generate their offsping.
Conventionally, long periods of time on Planisuss are measured in years, decades and centuries,
where a year is 100 days long, a decade is 10 years long, and a century is 10 decades long.
